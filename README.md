# Tasks
## Classification and clustering
 - Investigate the performance improvements (accuracy/time taken) in using graphons to embed the graph vs using graph2vec embedding
  - Realisation of graphons is done using (histogram approximate)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1888.pdf]
 - For classification task, traditional Machine learning model like Random Forest Classifier is used
 - For clustering task, spectral clustering is implemented
